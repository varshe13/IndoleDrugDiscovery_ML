# Drug Discovery

## Introduction
The discovery of antibiotics can be considered one of the main achievements of the 20th century. Unfortunately, the uncontrolled usage of these powerful tools against bacteria led to tremendous growth of resistances to different types of antibiotics in bacteria. As a result, in the beginning of the 21st century, we have to speak about the post-antibiotics era. According to some estimates, multidrug-resistant bacteria are responsible for more than 50,000 deaths annually in the USA and Europe. The World Health Organization published a list of bacteria that urgently require new antibiotics. That list divides the bacteria according to their threat and includes a large family of bacteria that can be acquired in hospitals. The group of hospital infections was called “ESKAPE pathogens” based on the first letters of bacteria names Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and was given “critical” priority.

Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance for ESKAPE bacteria include the modification of proteins targeted by the antibiotic, enzymatic deactivation of the antibiotic, reduction of the antibiotic’s ability to enter the cell, transference of resistance genes between organisms, and expulsion of the antibiotic from the cell using efflux pumps.

The development of new antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action can be one of the strategies to target drug-resistant bacteria, which can cause severe and widespread infection in nursing homes and hospitals and are not susceptible to existent antibiotic treatment.

The idea behind the project is to collect enough data to design compounds against ESKAPE bacteria based on an indole core or indole-like core. Indole is one of the most successful pharmacophores. Many critically important natural compounds contain an indole core, including the amino acid tryptophan, the neurotransmitter serotonin, and the hormone melatonin. There are many clinically successful indole-based drugs against different forms of cancers, parasites, and viruses. So far, many promising antibacterial indole-containing compounds have been synthesized, but none have moved into the clinic yet. The modern library of indole derivatives contains hundreds of compounds with known biological properties.
